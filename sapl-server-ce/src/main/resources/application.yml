# The following options enable or disable different levels of logging for decisions.
#
# print-trace: true|false This is the most fine-grained explanation of a decision made
#                         by the PDP each individual calculation step is documented.
#                         The trace is in JSON format and may become very large.
#                         Recommended only as a last resort for troubleshooting.
      print-trace: true
# print-json-report: true|false This is a JSON report summarizing the applied algorithms
#                               and results of each evaluated policy (set) in the
#                               decision-making process. It includes lists of all errors and values
#                               of policy information point attributes encountered
#                               during the evaluation of each policy (set).
      print-json-report: true
# print-text-report: true|false This will log a human-readable textual report based on the
#                               same data as the 'print-json-report' option generates.
      print-text-report: true
# pretty-print-reports: true|false This option can enable formatting of JSON data while
#                                  printing JSON during reporting and tracing.
